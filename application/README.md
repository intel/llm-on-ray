[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://langchain-chatbot.streamlit.app/)

Langchain is a powerful framework designed to streamline the development of applications using Language Models (LLMs). \
It provides a comprehensive integration of various components, simplifying the process of assembling them to create robust applications.

## üí¨ Sample chatbot use cases
Here are a few examples of chatbot implementations using Langchain and Streamlit:
-  **Basic Chatbot** \
  Engage in interactive conversations with the LLM.

-  **SQL Chat with your database** \
  Empower the chatbot with the ability to access custom SQL documents, enabling it to provide answers to user queries based on the referenced SQL database.

### TODOs

- **Chatbot with your code** \
  Empower the chatbot with the ability to access custom code, enabling it to provide answers to user queries based on the referenced code.

- **Multi modal chatbot** \
  Combine text, voice, and image inputs to provide a more natural and engaging conversation experience.
